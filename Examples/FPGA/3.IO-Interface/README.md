# IO Interface Cases

Common IO interface cases provide LED case and PWM generator case.

## LED Case

At present, [LED Case](/Examples/FPGA/3.IO-Interface/LED) demonstrates the on-board LED blinking experiment and the RGB LED breathing lamp discoloration experiment.

## PWM Generator Case

At present, [PWM Generator Case](/Examples/FPGA/3.IO-Interface/PWM) supports PWM generation with adjustable frequency and duty cycle.
