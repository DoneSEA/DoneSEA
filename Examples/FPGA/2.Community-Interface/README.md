# Community Interface Cases

Communication interface cases currently provide SPI case and UART case.

## SPI Case

This part currently provides [SPI Master](/Examples/FPGA/2.Community-Interface/SPI/SPI_Demo), cooperating with the [Arduino SPI Slave](/Examples/FPGA/2.Community-Interface/SPI/SPI-Arduino/SPI_Slave) to realize the unidirectional data transmission. In addition, [Arduino SPI Master](/Examples/FPGA/2.Community-Interface/SPI/SPI-Arduino/SPI_Master) is also provided.

## UART Case

This case currently supports two-way transmission, the case transmits the received data back.
