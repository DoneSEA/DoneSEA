PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[0]_P_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[1]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ww/design_1_i/pic16c56_0/inst/A1/yi_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
